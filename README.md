# SpeakUp SD Showcase

Public product showcase for **SpeakUp SD**, a voice-first system design interview practice product.

SpeakUp SD helps candidates turn interview preparation into a repeatable loop: choose a realistic system design prompt, explain the architecture aloud, draw the system, and review AI feedback grounded in the practice session.

## Public Boundary

This repository is intentionally limited to public-facing product content:

- product positioning
- screenshots and demo flow assets
- static GitHub Pages implementation
- links to legal and production app surfaces

It does **not** include private application source code, credentials, internal specifications, deployment secrets, customer data, model prompts, evaluation datasets, or operational runbooks.

## Product Notes

SpeakUp SD is built around a simple product belief: system design confidence comes from reps, evidence, and feedback.

The showcase focuses on the visible user experience rather than the private implementation. The product itself includes practice prompts, spoken-answer flow, whiteboard work, reports, progress surfaces, and trust/legal pages.

Built by **[Zoe](https://zoe-site-ten.vercel.app)** — practical AI products where evaluation, privacy, and backend reality are part of the product design.

## Maintenance

This repo is suitable for GitHub Pages. Updates should keep the page focused, screenshot-driven, and safe for public review.
